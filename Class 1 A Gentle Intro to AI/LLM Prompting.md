### Overview

- **LLMs** (Large Language Models) are role players in conversations.
- **Not trained to be inherently good**, but to sound natural.

---

## How to Get Good Answers from LLMs

1. **Be Specific**
    - Clear, specific instructions improve responses.
2. **Write Clear Instructions**
    - Avoid ambiguity by providing direct, concise guidance.
3. **Frame Responses Properly**
    - Write prompts in the way you want the model to respond.
4. **Avoid Leading Questions**
    - Ensure your questions are neutral to avoid bias in responses.
5. **Provide Reference Text**
    - Referencing specific content helps the model contextualize better.
6. **Limit Conversation Length**
    - Models perform worse in long conversations. For lengthy content (e.g., 50+ pages), break it into manageable chunks.

---

## Learning with Examples: **Few-Shot Learning**

- LLMs can learn from **a few examples**.
- Show the model the correct pattern through example-based prompts.

---

## Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

- **Let the model know what steps to take** during complex tasks.
- Ideal for:
    1. **Long and complex tasks**
    2. **Breaking down subtasks** (understanding the task, high-level reasoning, writing, refining).

---

## Handing Over the Reigns: **Self-Prompting**

- If unsure about what to prompt, ask the model for guidance.
- Example: You can request the model to ask itself a set of questions for self-guided prompting.

---

## Practical Example: AP Language Rhetorical Analysis

### Step 1: **Plan**

- Clearly outline what you aim to achieve.

### Step 2: **Chain of Thought Prompting**

- Break down the task into smaller parts:
- E.g in the context of essay writing:
    1. Fully understand the task.
    2. Conduct high-level reasoning.
    3. Write the full essay.
    4. Refine the essay.

---

### Summary

- Use **few-shot learning** to show examples.
- Employ **Chain of Thought prompting** for complex tasks.
- **Self-prompting** allows the model to take initiative when you’re unsure how to proceed.
- Always focus on **concise**, **clear**, and **specific prompts** for best results.
